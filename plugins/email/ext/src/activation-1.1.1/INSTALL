Installing GNU JAF


Configuration

The configure program configures GNU JAF for your system. The various
programs required to build GNU JAF should be automatically identified.
If they aren't, or you wish to override the default programs found, you can
do so here. Set the environment variable corresponding to the program you
wish to change befre running configure, e.g.:

    JAVAC=/my/special/javac ./configure

The default should work for most environments:

    ./configure

There are a number of options that can be set to add common flags to the
Java compiler, VM and other tools. For instance, to add the flag "-g" to
the compiler to enable line numbers in stack traces, specify

    ./configure --with-javac-flags=-g

The full list of options is available by passing the --help option to the
configure script.


Building

To build GNU JAF, type the following at the command prompt:

    make

You may additionally build the API documentation in Javadoc format (you need
the javadoc program in your PATH for this):

    make javadoc


Installation

To install, simply type:

    make install

This installs activation.jar in $(prefix)/share/java (see the configuration
options to change the prefix variable).


Ant build

A simple Ant buildfile is included for platforms where GNU Make is not
installed. This buildfile is not officially supported and may not provide
options available during the standard autotools-based installation.

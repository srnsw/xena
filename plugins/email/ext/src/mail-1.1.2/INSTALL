Installing GNU JavaMail


Dependencies

GNU JavaMail depends on a JAF implementation and GNU inetlib. GNU
distributes its own JAF implementation as part of the ClasspathX project:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/

The GNU inetlib library is a separate module within the aegis of the
Classpath project:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/

The latest release at time of writing is version 1.1.1:

  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/classpath/inetlib-1.1.1.tar.gz

The configuration script will search for these jarfiles in some standard
locations, or you can use the --with-activation-jar and --with-inetlib-jar
configuration options to specify your own locations. At runtime, you will
need to reference these libraries in your classpath along with the JavaMail
jarfiles.


Configuration

The configure program configures GNU JavaMail for your system. The various
programs required to build GNU JavaMail should be automatically identified.
If they aren't, or you wish to override the default programs found, you can
do so here. Set the environment variable corresponding to the program you
wish to change befre running configure, e.g.:

	JAVAC=/my/special/javac ./configure

The default should work for most environments:

	./configure

You can exclude specific providers from being built if you want to save
space. Set the corresponding configuration option to "no", e.g.:

	./configure --enable-nntp=no --enable-maildir=no

A full list of configuration options is available by entering:

	./configure --help

at the command prompt.


Building

To build GNU JavaMail, type the following at the command prompt:

	make

You may additionally build the API documentation in Javadoc format (you need
the javadoc program in your PATH for this):

	make javadoc

GNU JavaMail requires at least version 1.4 of the Java libraries.


Installation

To install, simply type:

    make install

This installs gnumail.jar and gnumail-providers.jar in $(prefix)/share/java
(see the configuration options to change the prefix variable).


Ant build

A simple Ant buildfile is included for platforms where GNU Make is not
installed. This buildfile is not officially supported and may not provide
options available during the standard autotools-based installation.

This library gives us proper JavaSound api with id3 frame support for MP3s, it uses tritonus_share and javalayer. 

The build file doesn't contain a clean target so we have to add one ourselves:
  <target name="clean">
     <delete dir="classes" />
  </target>

Then all thats left is a little cleaning up un-needed files!

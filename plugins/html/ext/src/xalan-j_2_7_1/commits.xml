<Modified> xml-xalan/java/src/org/apache/xalan/xsltc/dom NodeSortRecord.java NodeSortRecordFactory.java SortSettings.java</Modified>
<Log>
Restored old constructor of NodeSortRecordFactory and _collator field of
NodeSortRecord for binary compatibility.  These changes allow translets
compiled with an earlier version of XSLTC to continue to run with the new
version.  They should not be used in newly compiled translets or in new code
in XSLTC itself.<br/>

Also introduced a SortSettings class that is used to bundle sort settings from
NodeSortRecordFactory into instances of NodeSortRecord.  That reduces some of
the space overhead in constructing a NodeSortRecord.<br/>

Applying patch for bugs 27932 and 15333.<br/>

Code was incorrectly calculating the set of templates to which an
xsl:apply-imports instruction applies.  It should consider all templates that
the current template rule could override, which means that if the template
appeared in a stylesheet that was included in another stylesheet, any templates
imported into the including stylesheet have to be considered as well.  The
method Stylesheet.getMinimumDescendantPrecedence is responsible for this
calculation.<br/>

In addition, when code is generated for an xsl:apply-imports, if any template
has local parameters, an empty stack frame has to be pushed before attempting
to apply-imports.  Otherwise, parameters from the template that contains the
apply-imports instruction will be passed into the matching template.<br/>

<Log>
The problem is that about 1800 * Thread_num  XRTreeFrag  objects were created. 
It took too long for finalizer to be executed to release the references.<br/>

A lot of the objects have the same DTMs (and one XPathContext per thread).
In my fix I am suggesting 
a. to have new class DTMXRTreeFrag. The object of the class would 
be created only for different DTMs (just 5 objects). 
b. release the references to  DTM and XPathContext from XPathContext.reset()
(and remove finalize() ).

<Log>
The problem is that we use an object pool (shared between different threads)
to allocate  FastStringBuffer objects. The problem results in a serious performance
degradation  on Z/OS and seems to be invisible on AIX.<br/>
1 Differences in optimization of object pools  for different JVMs and for different 
platforms are known(I know it now too). It is not surprising that  Z/OS and AIX 
have different results.<br/>
2. a. Object pools should be used only for very heavy object which live for a long time
and could be reused in a lot of places. 
b. Small local objects which size cannot be changed could be allocated on the
stack =&gt; creating them with new in the local scope could be a good idea.
c. Caching middle size objects which can grow in size seems as a good idea,
because such objects usually cannot be allocated on the stack.<br/>
This is actually the case for FastStringBuffer objects. <br/>
Solution<br/>
I am creating FastStringBuffer objects in a local scope. I am going
to use caching whenever possible.

A fix to add a temporary vs. permanent output state to the serializer
(AKA result-tree-handler).  In theory the XSLT processor should set the
temporary or permanent output state, but we observer that when the
encoding of a ToTextStream serializer is null, then such a serializer is
in temporary output state.<br/>

In temorary output state we don't do any escaping or encoding or other 
sorts of normalization on output. This will be done by another serializer 
later on, and that one will be in permanent output state.

executeQuery will always retrurn a result set even if the query does not return any  rows

Patch from Yash Talwar (ytalwar@ca.ibm.com) for XALANJ-1186.<br/>
The existing code in the interpretive processor was handling namespace::pre by
resolving the namespace prefix "pre" in the stylesheet, and then looking for
namespace nodes with that same URI in the input document.  In fact, it should
look for namespaces nodes in the input document that declare the prefix "pre",
without regard to the associated URI.<br/>
The patch was reviewed by myself (zongaro@ca.ibm.com).

Patch for bug report XALANJ-1994.<br/>

The CallTemplate.getCalleeTemplate() method was searching through a Vector of
all templates defined by the logical stylesheet, and picked out the first with
the same name referenced by the current xsl:call-template instruction.  However,
that failed to account for import precedence.  The SymbolTable.lookupTemplate
method takes into account import precedence, and should be used instead.<br/>

Patch for XALANJ-1955.  The equals(Object) method contains a list of
instanceof checks, and then casts the Object argument to the tested type in
order to dispatch to a more specific equals method.  In the case where the
Object argument was an XMLString, the code was actually casting "this" to
XMLString - thus testing this.equals(this), which will always be true.<br/>

Patch for XALANJ-1368.<br/>

The method getKeyDeclaration was looping through all the xsl:key elements
defined, and returning the first with the required name.  However, more than
one xsl:key element can specify the same name, and should be treated
cumulatively.  Modified the method so that it returns all elements with the
required name, and the caller so that it tries to match against the patterns
associated with all such elements.<br/>

<Log>
Patch for XALANJ-2003. Problem was unrelated to recursion, but simply a bug in the basis library. Swapping 
operands requires swapping operators and the latter was not done. A workaround for this bug would be to 
swap the operands (and operator) in the stylesheet (as that would not cause any swapping in the basis library).

Patch for bug report XALANJ-2008<br/>
Based on Sun's Security Code Guidelines, modified the code to improve the security. Major changes includes:<br/>
1. Added final modifier to static variables;<br/>
2. Reduced scope and added public get methods whenever it is appropriate;<br/>
3. Changed some static variable to instance variables;<br/>
4. Changed some interfaces to final classes, if those interfaces are used only to define constants<br/>
5. Removed the usage of System.exit;<br/>
6. For various org.apache.xml.utils.res.XResourceBundle, the getObject() methods return immutable array wrappers instead of arrays<br/>
7. Changed static methods of org.apache.xpath.compiler.FunctionTable to instance methods and the reference of a function table is passed 
around the processing to create an XPath object;<br/>
8. Changed the flags of FEATURE_INCREMENTAL, FEATURE_OPTIMIZE and FEATURE_SOURCE_LOCATION to instance variables in TransformerFactorImpl. 
So they will not be changed during a processing once a new Templates is created;<br/>

Applying patch for Jira bug report XALANJ-1640.<br/>

As it's currently written, SerializerUtils.outputResultTreeFragment loops
through the nodes in a result tree fragment, and for each one, it checks
whether the node is in some namespace.  If it is not, the code undeclares the
default namespace by calling handler.startPrefixMapping("", "").  The problem
is that if the RTF that's being copied just consists of a text node (or PIs or
comments), that undeclaration of the default namespace hangs around until some
subsequent child element picks it up as one of its attributes, even if that
element is in some namespace - even what should be the default!<br/>

The fix is to check whether the node that is being output is an element node
prior to issuing the handler.startPrefixMapping call - that ensures the prefix
mapping is not issued unless it's actually going to be used by the node that is
about to be serialized.<br/>

Two part fix for Jira bug report XALANJ-1888.<br/>

1) It is possible for the characters SAX event to specify a length of zero.
Text nodes should not be created in such situations.  Changed the
charactersFlush method to guard against this case.<br/>

2) Made a defensive change to references to m_dataOrQName.  If the value in
this vector is to be interpreted as an index into m_data, it is stored as a
negative value (via calls to addNode).  However, most references to elements of
m_dataOrQName were checking whether the value was non-positive, treating a
value of zero as an index into m_data as well.  The zeroth entry into m_data is
an invalid entry.
The fix to charactersFlush described above should ensure that zero is never
stored in m_dataOrQName, but I thought it was just as well to duplicate the
interpretation used in storing values in m_dataOrQName.<br/>

In the recursive descent parsing of an ill-formed XPath expression like "2+",
when the parser reaches the end of the expression while still looking for an
operand it ultimately ends up trying to see whether what remains can be parsed
as a location path.  However, the LocationPath method was silently parsing the
end of an expression as a location path!  Added an error for that situation.<br/>

Fix for XALANJ-1886. Multiple problems fixed related to collecting xsl:attributes 
with over-ridden values and prefix/URI maps.  With this fix, internally the
serializer correctly identifies attributes by their expanded QName, which 
includes the URI rather than the prefix.

Fix for XALANJ-2058.
In the code, the problem is that a pattern gets compiled once, 
and then this compiled pattern gets re-used whenever the pattern is
needed in any method.<br/>
The fix is that pattern should get compiled once per method.  So, pattern get reused only within a given method.
for any new method, a pattern is recompiled.<br/>
This fix has been reviewed by Henry Zongaro. Henry had also provided suggestions about the fix to resolve this issue.

This patch fixes XALANJ-1431. The patch has been reviewed by Brian.
The problem is that that when an empty attribute value is encountered, a text node is being created 
with empty string. <br/>
Henry Zongaro has helped finding the XSLT 1.0 specs. that suggest a text node with empty string should not be created. 
URL http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#value-of has the following information: 
"The xsl:value-of element is instantiated to create a text node in the result tree. The required select attribute is an 
expression; this expression is evaluated and the resulting object is converted to a string as if by a call to the string 
function. The string specifies the string-value of the created text node. If the string is empty, no text node will be 
created. The created text node will be merged with any adjacent text nodes."

This is a fix for XALANJ-2081.
In class org.apache.xalan.xsltc.compiler.Text, a check was being done to find out if a given text string is all whitespaces.
In case, a given text string is all whitespace, a call to serializer is not made.
The code was using trim() method from java.lang.String.  trim() method trimmed characters as whitespaces 
that are not considered as whitespace in XML.
The code logic is changed to check if a given string is all whitespace accoding to XML specifications.
I would like to thank Michael Glavassevich and Brian Minchau for their input to resolve this issue.

org.apache.xalan.templates.ElemNumber.java has raised some performance issue as 
a static array to hold resources was removed earlier.  However, the removal of static array is necessary
to fix a potential bug multithread environment, where a given thread can request different locale than another thread.

This patch resolves the performance glicth that was found in internal testing.

Patch for XALANJ-2136.<br/>
Support the secure processing feature in Xalan interpretive. When this feature
is set to true, the following XML processing limits are applied:<br/>
1. extension functions and extension elements are disabled.<br/>
2. parsers created by the XSLT processor also have the secure processing feature set
to true.<br/>

A new option -secure is added to the Process command line to enable the secure
processing feature.

<Log>
Fix for XALANJ-1938.<br/>

A KeyIndex object contains a Hashtable mappings from key values to the
IntegerArray objects that contain the set of nodes selected by those key values.
For a reference to the key function, the lookupKey method finds the nodes
selected by a particular key value, and the merge method merges all the nodes
selected if more than one key value is specified for the one refernce to the key
function.<br/>

The problem was that the lookupKey and merge methods operated on the "live"
versions of the IntegerArrays stored in the mapping Hashtable, so that one
reference to the key function might affect the result of subsequent references
to the key function.  Changed those methods to make clones of the selected
IntegerArray objects, which can be safely modified without affecting the
original IntegerArrays.<br/>

Patch for bug XALANJ-2097 from Nick Van den Bleeken.
(Nick.VandenBleeken@pandora.be), reviewed by Henry Zongaro.<br/>

The code generated for a path expression of the form $var/self::node() was
incorrect.  It looked like the following, where "i" refers to the context node.<br/><br/>

  new StepIterator(dtmaxisiterator1.cloneIterator(), new SingletonIterator(i));<br/><br/>

That's incorrect, because the SingletonIterator will only return the node used
upon its instantiation, rather than the node provided from the parent step
expression by the StepIterator.<br/>

The SingletonIterator should only be used if the self::node() is not a step
in a path expression.  In the case of a path expression, dom.getAxisIterator
should be used to create the axis iterator instead.

Patch for XALANJ-2146.  Reviewed by Christine Li (jycli@ca.ibm.com).<br/>

Section 4.3.4 of the JVM specification prohibits an uninitialized object from
appearing on the stack or in a local variable when a backwards branch is
executed.  We need to guard against that in the generated code in XSLTC by
storing arguments to constructors in temporary variables if there's any
possibility that the code used to calculate such arguments might contain a
backwards branch.

Fix for bug report XALANJ-2140.<br/>

The AbstractTranslet._keyIndexes field is used to record the sets of keys
for a particular transformation by name.  This table was not cleared at the
end of a transformation, so the keys from one transformation persisted to
subsequent transformations.  Fixed this by adding a try-finally block in
the AbstractTranslet.transform method and setting _keyIndexes to null in the
finally block.<br/>

Entire source tree and support packages are located in the single jar
file 'apache.jar'. 


Installation
-------------

(1) create directory [Root], unpack 'apache.jar' there.
	ex) % cd /tmp; mkdir xsltc_apache 
	    % cd xsltc_apache
        copy apache.jar to xsltc_apache directory
	    % jar xvf apache.jar 
	cleanup
	    % rm -rf META-INF apache.jar

    Unpacking the jar file will result in the following tree:

	[Root]
	  External/
	    BCEL/                ... contains BCEL.jar
	    JLex/                ... contains JLex.jar
	    java_cup/            ... contains java_cup.jar, runtime/runtime.jar
	    xml-tr2/             ... contains xml.jar
	  bin/
	    xslt
	    xsltc
	  doc/
	    api/                 ... contains javadoc for api
	  src/
	    GNUmakefile
	    GNUmakefile.allinc
	    docs/
	      LICENSE.txt
	      Message.txt
	      README
	      README.api
	      README.xslt
	      README.xsltc
	      XSLTCprn_lg.txt*
	      xsltcA3.txt
	    org/
	      apache/
		xalan/
		  xsltc/
		     (src tree)  ... all the source code files


    The 'src tree' is a hierarchy of the following packages:
	org.apache.xalan.xsltc
	org.apache.xalan.xsltc.compiler
	org.apache.xalan.xsltc.compiler.util
	org.apache.xalan.xsltc.dom
	org.apache.xalan.xsltc.runtime
	org.apache.xalan.xsltc.util
	org.apache.xalan.xsltc.util.getopt


(2) make bin programs executable
	    % chmod +x bin/*

(3) set env variable to point to top of directory [Root]
	ex) % setenv XSLT /tmp/xsltc_apache

(4) compile sources (uses gnu make and the provides 'GNUmakefile'). This
    will create java classes in [Root]/classes, e.g. /tmp/xsltc_apache/classes.
    (No need to set your CLASSPATH variable.)
    
	ex) % cd src; gmake again

    Note: the 'again' target forces everything to be built from scratch,
    including the java_cup source files. Subsequent builds can be done
    using the 'classes' target. 

(5) make the javadoc
	ex) % gmake jdoc

(6) add bin directory to your executable path, 
	ex) % set path=($XSLT/bin $path)

(7) test distribution, given a stylesheet (test.xsl) and an input xml doc
    (test.xml), and be sure current working directory (.) is in your
    CLASSPATH.
 	% xsltc test.xsl		... creates translet, test.class
	% xslt test.xml test		... runs translet on xml input

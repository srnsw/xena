To get the OpenOffice.org UNO/UDK modules sourcecode you need to use cvs.

First we need to login to the CVS server:
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.services.openoffice.org:/cvs login

Then checkout the source code, to check out the entire udk source run:
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.services.openoffice.org:/cvs checkout udk_src
NOTE: This will checkout the source to the current directory, so make sure your in an empty directory first.

But we actually only use 4 of the libraries so we can just check them out with:
	cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.services.openoffice.org:/cvs checkout jurt javaunohelper ridljar unoil

There are no build instructions I could find at the time of writing this info, and we cannot build a buildfile of our own because alot of the required java files are in a different idl based language which is converted into java, so builing isn't really an option until we can find some sort of build instructions. 
So for the time being we need to dump this checked out source into the src folder and then grab the jars.

Getting the jars
===================
We needed to grab a copy of the ure/udk jars from OpenOffice.org V3 as these are LGPL V3. So grab the tar.gz release from the website and extract it.

The required libraries and where they can be found in the extracted installation at:
	unoil.jar 	-> RPMS/ooobasis3.1-core03-3.1.1-9420.i586.rpm
	juh.jar		-> \
	jurt.jar	->  ---> RPMS/openoffice.org-ure-1.5.1-9420.i586.rpm
	ridl.jar	-> /

We converted the rpm files to tgz files using the alien command:
	alien --to-tgz <rpm file>

Then used file-roller to extract the jar files individually. 

We hope to resolve this in the future, but at least for now we have the jars and the source.

	        <p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 1.3</a> released.</p>
		<p>We're pleased to release an updated version of the jFLAC library.</p>
		<p>A number of bugs have been fixed, some optimizations added, UTF-8 conversions for Vorbis Comments, and support for
		   metadata type Picture. The jFLAC library was built using JDK 1.6 and the web site was updated to Maven2.
		   The jar file was built using NetBeans 6.0.</p>
		<p>There are currently a number of issues that we are working to address: the encoder is not supported, the unit
		   tests are not working, the bugs, issues, and support requests haven't been cleaned up, and various aspects of the
		   code base need to be cleaned up (remove old state machine comments, improve javadocs, etc.)</p>
		<p>Additionally, some of the applications work, and some don't. Specifically, SeekTablePlayer, SndPlayer,
		   and Tester DO NOT WORK. These issues should be addressed in the next release.</p>
		<p>As always, comments, suggestions, and help are all appreciated.</p>

			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 1.1</a> released!</p>
			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>This release fixes a bug in the java Sound SPI. This bug caused a problem when
			the jFLAC SPI was used in a player with other SPIs. It would prevent non-flac
			files from being played if the jFLAC SPI was included in the class path.</p>

			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 1.0</a> released!</p>
			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>The most significant change in this release is the inclusion of a Java Sound SPI
               module. To use the Java Sound SPI, simply include the jFLAC jar file in your
               classpath. Other changes include:
			<ul>
   				<li>FlacPacker application. This application packs a number of individual flac files into one flac file.
   				    The separate flac files are indexed with a seek table.</li>
   				<li>SeekTablePlayer application. This application plays a section of a flac file between two seek points.</li>
   				<li>InputBitStream renamed to BitInputStream.</li>
				<li>OutputBitStream renamed to BitOutputStream.</li>
				<li>StreamDecoder renamed to FLACDecoder.</li>
				<li>StreamEncoder renamed to FLACEncoder.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>This release features a new player application that will play a flac file
			using the Java sound API. I've also added new listener interfaces to the library.
			The FrameListener is called after every flac packet is processed. This is now
			used by the Analyser application. The PCMProcessor is called after every frame
			is decoded. This is now used by the Decoder application</p>

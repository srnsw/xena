INTRODUCTION
============

im4java is a pure-java interface to the ImageMagick
commandline. It is not meant as a replacement for JMagick, but as an addition.

JMagick is a thin JNI layer above the ImageMagick C-API. im4java in
contrast just generates the commandline for the ImageMagick commands and
passes the generated line to the selected IM-command (using the 
java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start()-method).

Disadvantages of the approach: your are limited to the capabilities of the
IM commands. With JMagick, you have access to the low-level interface of
IM and therefore you have a very detailed control of the processing of images.

Advantages of im4java: the interface of the IM commandline is quite stable,
so your java program (and the im4java-library) will work across many versions.
im4java also provides a better OO interface (the "language" of the
IM-commandline with it's postfix-operation notation translates very easily
into OO-notation). And most important: you can use im4java everywhere
JMagick can't be used because of the JNI hazard (e.g. java application servers).


Features
========

- supports most ImageMagick commands
- reuse a commandline multiple times for different set of images
- IM options and operators translate into similar method-names, e.g.
    -resize 1024           -> .resize(1024) or .resize(1024,null)
    -resize 1024x768       -> .resize(1024,768)
    -resize x768           -> .resize(null,768)
    -sigmoidal-contrast 20 -> .sigmoidalContrast(20.)
    -append                -> .append()
    +append                -> .p_append()
- you can pipe input to and from ImageMagick commands
- you can execute the commands asynchronously
- BufferedImage support, i.e you can use BufferedImages as input to
  IM commands and pipe output of IM commands into a BufferedImage
- scarce documentation (but many examples in src/org/im4java/test/Test.java)
- the architecture supports arbitrary commandline-tools (already implemented:
  ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick, jpegtran, ufraw, exiftool, dcraw)


INSTALLATION
============

There is no formal installation method. If you have downloaded the
source-distribution, you should run

$ > make jar

This will compile all source-files and generate the im4java library.

Running

$ > make test

will exercise a number of tests.

If you downloaded the binary-distribution, run

$ > make test-prepare
$ > java -jar im4java-<version>.jar all

to run all the tests.


USAGE
=====

The central class of the im4java-package is IMOperation. A very simple
code-snippet is:

import org.im4java.core.*;

IMOperation op = new IMOperation();
op.addImage("myimage.jpg");
op.resize(1024,768);
op.addImage("myimage-small.jpg");
ConvertCmd convert = new ConvertCmd();
convert.run(op);

You can also reuse an IMOperation:

IMOperation op = new IMOperation();
op.addImage().addImage();           // adds placeholders
op.append();
op.addImage();                      // placeholder for output-file

String[] images = new String[] {"image1.jpg","image2.jpg","result1.tif"};

ConvertCmd convert = new ConvertCmd();
convert.run(op,images);
convert.run(op,"image3.jpg","image4.jpg","result2.tif");

As you can see, you can pass an array of images or a variable number
of image names to the run()-method.

There are a number of subclasses of IMOperation (e.g. ChannelMixer,
NoiseFilter) which wrap more complex image manipulation operations based
on a combination of IM operators. The list of subclasses is likely to
grow in the future.

For more examples see the file src/org/im4java/test/Test.java.


FEEDBACK
========

Any feedback (bug-reports, suggestions, criticism) is welcome. 
Currently, JMagick and im4java share a single mailing-list. You should
register to the jmagick-users mailing-list at jmagick.sourceforge.net.

Installing GNU inetlib


Dependencies

GNU inetlib depends on a JSSE implementation and the
javax.security.auth.callback and javax.security.sasl libraries. The
GNU-Crypto project distributes the latter two libraries:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-crypto/

A free JSSE implementation (jsse.jar) is available from the Jessie project:

  http://www.nongnu.org/jessie/

The configuration script will search for the required classes in the
classpath. If not found, you will have to specify the jarfiles containing
these classes. GNU Classpath's glibj.zip contains implementations of all
the required classes. Note that the classes will need to be available in
your classpath at runtime.


Configuration

The configure program configures GNU inetlib for your system. The various
programs required to build GNU inetlib should be automatically identified.
If they aren't, or you wish to override the default programs found, you can
do so here. Set the environment variable corresponding to the program you
wish to change befre running configure, e.g.:

	JAVAC=/my/special/javac ./configure

The default should work for most environments:

	./configure

You can exclude specific protocol clients from being built if you want to
save space. Set the corresponding configuration option to "no", e.g.:

	./configure --enable-nntp=no --enable-gopher=no

A full list of configuration options is available by entering:

	./configure --help

at the comand prompt.


Building

To build GNU inetlib, type the following at the command prompt:

	make

You may additionally build the API documentation in Javadoc format (you need
the javadoc program in your PATH for this):

	make javadoc


Installation

To install, simply type:

	make install

This installs inetlib.jar in $(prefix)/share/java (see the configuration
options to change the prefix variable).


Ant build

A simple Ant buildfile is included for platforms where GNU Make is not
installed. This buildfile is not officially supported and may not provide
options available during the standard autotools-based installation.
